Primary Features:
Clears the map of biters, ore, trees, rocks, and more, and makes it smooth flat grass
Blueprints now place the entities directly, not ghosts
Preexisting ghosts are automatically converted to proper entities
Placing items does not consume them from your hotbar
Mining items does not add them to your hotbar, unless you have none of them
Deconstructing instantly destroys entities and adds one of them to your inventory if you do not already have any
